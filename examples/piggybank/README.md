# Piggy bank web application

The example project included in this repository, serves as a working example of how to integrate with smart contracts on the Concordium blockchain.
It both includes a page for a V0 and a V1 version of the piggy bank smart contract.

## Prerequisites

-   Browser wallet extension must be installed in google chrome and configured with testnet JSON-RPC, in order to view smart contract details or submit transactions.

## Installing

-   Run `yarn` in package root.
-   Build concordium helpers by running `yarn build:all`.

## Running the example

-   Run `yarn build` in a terminal
-   Run `yarn start`
-   Open URL logged in console (typically http://127.0.0.1:8080)

To have hot-reload (useful for development), do the following instead:

-   Run `yarn watch` in a terminal
-   Run `yarn start` in another terminal
-   Open URL logged in console (typically http://127.0.0.1:8080)
