# Voting web application

The example project serves as a working example of how to integrate with smart contracts on the Concordium blockchain. You can create and customize your own voting smart contract via the front-end and deploy it to the Concordium chain. The front-end also provides pages to conduct the voting and display the voting results.

## Prerequisites

-   The Concordium browser wallet extension must be installed in google chrome and connected to testnet, in order to view smart contract details or submit transactions.

## Installing

-   Run `yarn` in package root.
-   Build concordium helpers by running `yarn build:api-helpers`.

## Running the voting example

-   Run `yarn build` in a terminal in this folder.
-   Run `yarn start`.
-   Open URL logged in console (typically http://127.0.0.1:8080).

To have hot-reload (useful for development), do the following instead:

-   Run `yarn watch` in a terminal.
-   Run `yarn start` in another terminal.
-   Open URL logged in console (typically http://127.0.0.1:8080).

## Build and run the Docker image

To build the docker image run the following:

```
docker build -t voting_app_image .
```

To run the docker image run the following:

```
docker run -it -d -p 8080:80 --name voting_app voting_app_image
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser.
