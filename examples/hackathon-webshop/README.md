# Webshop

This example serves to show how ZKP's generated by the browser wallet could be used in a web application.

## Prerequisites

-   Browser wallet extension must be installed in google chrome and configured with testnet JSON-RPC, in order to view smart contract details or submit transactions.

## Installing

-   Run `yarn` in package root.
-   Build concordium helpers by running `yarn build:all`.

## Running the example

### Start the backend server

-   In a terminal, go to directory of webshop backend `cd ../../deps/concordium-use-case-examples/webshop`
-   Start the server `cargo run --release -- --node <node-url>:<node-port>`

### Start the frontend server

-   Run `yarn build` in a terminal
-   Run `yarn start`
-   Open URL logged in console (typically http://127.0.0.1:8080)

To have hot-reload (useful for development), do the following instead:

-   Run `yarn watch` in a terminal
-   Run `yarn start` in another terminal
-   Open URL logged in console (typically http://127.0.0.1:8080)
